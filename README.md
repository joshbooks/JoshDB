I thought I'd take a crack at writing a database. Not like a SQL database, more like Datomic meets LevelDB. 
I have no intention of setting deadlines or deciding exactly what features it must include. I'm just kinda
hacking on it and seeing if I can make something cool. Essentially I want browsers to be in memory read replicas,
synchronization primitives that make sense and are backed by hardware instead of ever more intense attempts to 
pin down the illusion of time, and an ORM first interface (because tables are for accountants, not programmers)
