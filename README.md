# JoshDB

I thought I'd take a crack at writing a database. Not like a SQL database, more like Datomic meets LevelDB. 
Essentially I want browsers to be in memory read replicas,
synchronization primitives that make sense and are backed by hardware instead of ever more intense attempts to 
pin down the illusion of time, and an ORM first interface (because tables are for accountants, not programmers)
